#Pillars of OOP


# Abstraction
# makes complicated actions easier for our users
# for example accletate and it just happnes
# they do anything for accelerate to happen
# even with multiple steps the user has access without having to do anything
#

#providing methods ot interact
# just does it

# Encapsulation
#e.g __speed in our Car module
# encapusalte within a module and it cannot be interfered with
# restricts direct access
# e.g. toaster leavers, we dont worry about the circuit
# and the heater coil, instead they interact with the dial
# to contol the hear

# Inheritance
# toaster, can use two slot toaster and expand it to a 4 slot
# toaster
# can use parent class to create a sub class and the
# sub class has access to he parent classes method
#
#
#Polymorphism

# sub class can have different methods to the parent class
#
