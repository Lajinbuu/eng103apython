# Test- Driven Development

# you write the tests before you write your code
# RED -> GREEN -> REFACTOR the code will first fail, you then change the code until it works

# Unit testing, testing the individual units

# test driven development forces you to produce code that requires inputs and outputs
# forces you to produce testable code
